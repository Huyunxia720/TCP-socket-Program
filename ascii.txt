Nostalgia
Yu Guangzhong
When I was young,
Nostalgia was a tiny, tiny stamp,
Me on this side,
Mother on the other side.
When I grew up,
Nostalgia was a narrow boat ticket,
Me on this side,
Bride on the other side.
But later on,
Nostalgia was a lowly grave,
Me on the outside,
Mother on the inside.
And at present,
Nostalgia becomes a shallow strait,
Me on this side,
Mainland on the other side.
